# Nandy TODO

## Design
* Update design documentation to account for new 16-bit datapath
* Formalize specs for macros

## Simulation
* Start putting together datapath
* Carry handling in ALU incl. comparison ops
* Make comparison module not suck

## Toolchain
### Compiler
* Look into modifying GCC/similar to compile to NANDy ASM (maybe?)

### Assembler
* Macros
* "Standard library" functions

### Emulator
* Better debugger (with disassembly?)

## Hardware
* New register design using pulse former
